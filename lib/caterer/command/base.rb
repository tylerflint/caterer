      # This method will split the argv given into three parts: the

      # subcommand. For example:
      #
      #     -v status -h -v

      #
      #     ["-v"]
      #     "status"
      #     ["-h", "-v"]
      #
      # These parts are useful because the first is a list of arguments
      # given to the current command, the second is a subcommand, and the
      # third are the commands given to the subcommand.
